# Atomic Signals

The base setup of this project is containing vite as a build tool instead of the create react app (CRA). This will enable HMR (Hot Module Reload) in our development environment.

**To run the project, use**
```cmd
npm run vite
```

**To build the project (usually present in /dist), use**
```cmd
npm run build
```

**To view the final project build (usually present in /dist), use**
```cmd
npm run preview
```
